Coverage guided fuzzing is cool, but things to keep in mind;

Reconnaissance:
    * What If
    * Build process
    * How many Interface/library
    * How dose those library works

Coverage:
    - Statement
    - Edge coverage
    - Line coverage
    - Path coverage
    - Function coverage
    - Basic block coverage

Mutator:
    - AFL
    - libFuzzer
    - honggfuzz
    - Grammar mutation
    - libprotobuf-mutator
    - Symbolic execution



Bad Reconnaissance:
    - Missing things

Fase Positive:
    - Bad harness
    - Some bugs are needed

Roadblock:
    - Checksum, Magic number

Blockers:
    - Memory hogging
    - Too many layers from one harness

Moniter:
    - Sanitizer
    - System logs {File, Registry}



Other-bugs:
    - DOS;
    - Logical Bug;
    - Command Injection;



Fuzzing-type:
    - Memory
    - Differential
    - Encode Decode
